                                <p>I am a coffee and tea addict. Caffeine is love. Caffeine is life.</p>
                                <p>In my spare time you'll probably find me playing videogames, creating art, or reading. My fave games are Yakuza, Resident Evil, Shenmue, and Dragon Age. </p>
                                <p>My music tastes are all over the place. I'll go from listening to metal, to classical, to pop. I don't even care if I can't understand some of the musicians I listen to. Good music is good music. Sometimes I end up learning some vocab from different languages.</p>
                                <p>I'm not exactly the best cook. I can bake a bit, but I can't be trusted with fried foods. My last attempt at cooking a croquette yielded a sad and pathetic pile of charred dark matter. It was a mistake.</p>
                                <p>I have an irrational fear of butterflies. Yeah. They're very pretty to look at, but I freak out the moment they try to land on me. I spent a lot of my time trying to flee from them instead of admiring the pretty flowers in a butterfly garden once.</p>
